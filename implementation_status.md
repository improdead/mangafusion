# Implementation Status — Warp v0.5 (mangafusion)

## Summary
- End-to-end flow in place and runnable:
  - Backend (NestJS) with real Planner integration via Gemini (default model: gemini-2.5-flash), SSE streaming, and real image renderer (gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview).
  - Frontend (Next.js) to create an episode, view streaming pages with full-page modal view, and edit pages in a Studio editor.
  - **NEW**: AI Audiobook feature with ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 TTS integration for immersive manga reading.
  - Real-time planning status updates with detailed progress messages.
  - Dialogue integration in story planning and visual generation.
- Environment consolidated in single root .env file for easier deployment.
- Images and audio are uploaded to Supabase Storage by default (bucket configurable).
- Consistent 2:3 aspect ratio (1024x1536px) for all manga pages.

## Backend (NestJS) — Status
### Implemented
- Endpoints (all prefixed with /api/)
  - POST /api/planner — accepts seed (title, genre_tags, tone, setting, visual_vibe, cast), creates an episode, and calls Gemini (model default: gemini-2.5-flash). Falls back to a stub outline on API/model errors. Now emits planning status events.
  - GET  /api/episodes/:id — returns episode metadata including pages and rendererModel.
  - POST /api/episodes/:id/generate10 — generates pages 1–10 (sequentially) and emits SSE events.
  - GET  /api/episodes/:id/stream — SSE endpoint streaming planning_started, planning_progress, planning_complete, page_progress, page_done, page_failed.
  - GET  /api/pages/:id — returns page metadata (in-memory or DB-backed if Prisma enabled).
  - **NEW**: POST /api/pages/:id/read — ElevenLabs TTS integration for audiobook narration with voice selection.
  - GET  /api/episodes/:id/characters — returns per-episode character bible with generated images.
  - GET  /api/episodes/:id/style-refs — lists uploaded external style reference images for this episode (Supabase)
  - POST /api/episodes/:id/style-refs — multipart upload (field: file) to add a new style reference; stored in Supabase under episodes/<title>/style_refs/
  - GET  /api/pages/:id/overlays — returns saved editor overlays for a page.
  - POST /api/pages/:id/overlays — saves overlays for a page.
  - POST /api/pages/:id/regenerate — AI edit/regenerate a page from a user prompt, preserving characters and style.
  - **NEW**: GET /api/tts/voices — returns available ElevenLabs voices for selection.
  - **NEW**: GET /api/tts/models — returns available ElevenLabs TTS models.
  - **NEW**: GET /api/tts/usage — returns current ElevenLabs usage statistics and limits.
- Planner integration
  - Library: @google/generative-ai
  - Env: GEMINI_API_KEY (required), PLANNER_MODEL (optional; default gemini-2.5-flash)
  - Strict JSON extraction and validation (expects 10 pages).
  - **NEW**: Dialogue generation for each panel with character attribution, narration, and sound effects.
  - **NEW**: Real-time planning status events via SSE.
- Renderer configuration
  - Default image model: gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview (Nano Banana) via env RENDERER_IMAGE_MODEL.
  - Stored on the Episode as rendererModel for traceability.
  - Character generator for per-episode consistent references (uploads to Supabase under episodes/<title>/characters/<asset>.png).
  - Page renderer accepts optional baseImageUrl + editPrompt and automatically attaches referenced character images and any uploaded style reference images.
  - Initial page generation automatically attaches episode style refs if present.
  - **NEW**: Dialogue context integration for visual storytelling (dialogue informs visual composition without text in image).
  - **NEW**: Consistent 2:3 aspect ratio enforcement (1024x1536px) for all generated pages.
- Persistence (Prisma)
  - Prisma schema for Episode/Page with PageStatus enum.
  - Character model added; Page.overlays Json added.
  - If DATABASE_URL is set, planner creation writes Episode + 10 Page rows; simulated generation updates Page rows.
  - If DATABASE_URL is not set, in-memory storage is used.
- Queueing (BullMQ)
  - QueueService scaffolding for generate_page (enabled when REDIS_URL is set).
  - Worker stub (npm run worker:generate) uses RENDERER_IMAGE_MODEL default and updates Page rows (if DB enabled).
- SSE/Event Bus
  - In-memory RxJS Subjects keyed by episodeId.
- **NEW**: TTS Integration (ElevenLabs Flash v2.5)
  - Library: Native fetch API (Node.js 18+)
  - Env: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (required), ELEVENLABS_MODEL (default: eleven_flash_v2_5), ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID (optional)
  - Smart dialogue processing: combines character dialogue, narration, and sound effects with natural pauses
  - Voice selection support with real-time usage tracking
  - Audio storage in Supabase with MP3 format
- Config
  - Global /api prefix for all endpoints
  - Consolidated .env in root directory (no separate backend/.env)
  - CORS_ORIGIN configurable (default http://localhost:3000)

### Partial
- Validation: Minimal; should add DTOs + class-validator.
- Error handling: Basic.
- Edit flow: Implemented — /pages/:id/regenerate performs an AI edit using the current page image and character references.
- Renderer: **WORKING!** Real gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview integration generating manga pages and character sheets, uploaded to Supabase storage.
- Persistence: Prisma scaffolding present, but migrations and DB provisioning are pending.
- Queueing: BullMQ scaffolding present; app still uses in-process simulator for UI/SSE until GPU worker is wired.

### Not Implemented (infra required)
- BullMQ (Redis) queues and actual worker processes.
- Prisma + Postgres persistence.
- Vision/OCR + TTS integrations.
- Observability: Sentry + OTEL.

## Environment variables
- **Consolidated Root .env** (single file for both frontend and backend)
  - Frontend variables:
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000/api (required)
  - Backend variables:
    - GEMINI_API_KEY=... (required for real planner and image generation)
    - PLANNER_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash (default)
    - RENDERER_IMAGE_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview (default)
    - **NEW**: ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... (required for audiobook feature)
    - **NEW**: ELEVENLABS_MODEL=eleven_flash_v2_5 (default - Flash v2.5 for speed and cost efficiency)
    - **NEW**: ELEVENLABS_DEFAULT_VOICE_ID=pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB (optional - Adam voice)
    - SUPABASE_URL=... (required for image and audio storage)
    - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... (required for storage)

    - REDIS_URL=redis://... (optional to enable BullMQ)
    - PORT=4000 (default)
    - CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 (optional)

## How to run locally
- **Consolidated Setup**
  - Ensure root .env has GEMINI_API_KEY and ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (and optional overrides).
  - Run both servers: `./dev.sh` or manually:
    - Frontend: `npm run dev:frontend` (port 3000)
    - Backend: `npm run dev:backend` (port 4000 with /api prefix)

## What’s needed from you
- Confirm the default model choices are correct:
  - Planner: gemini-2.5-flash
  - Renderer (Nano Banana image model): gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview
- Provide infra details when ready to move beyond simulation:
  - Postgres DATABASE_URL, Redis URL, S3/R2 credentials, GPU worker endpoint/auth, TTS/Vision provider keys.
- Preference on adding Tailwind + React-Konva now vs. after backend integrations.

## Next recommended steps
1) ✅ Real image generation with gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview + Supabase storage
2) ✅ Character pipeline (planner + generation) and references in prompts
3) ✅ Studio editor with overlays and AI per-page edits
4) ✅ Real-time planning status updates and dialogue integration
5) ✅ Full-page viewing with navigation and consistent aspect ratios
6) ✅ AI Audiobook feature with ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 TTS integration
7) ✅ Consolidated environment configuration for easier deployment
8) Persistence (Prisma + Postgres) — migrations and deployment
9) Queueing (BullMQ + Redis) and a dedicated worker process
10) Planner hardening (strict schema validation + retries)
11) Export (PDF/CBZ) with optional audio tracks
12) Observability (Sentry + OTEL) and structured logging
