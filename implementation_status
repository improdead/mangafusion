Implementation Status — Warp v0.2 (mangafusion)

Summary
- A minimal end-to-end skeleton is implemented:
  - Backend (NestJS) exposes the required endpoints and an SSE stream.
  - A stubbed planner creates a 10-page outline.
  - A simulated renderer “generates” pages sequentially and streams page_progress and page_done events.
  - Frontend (Next.js) provides a simple form to create an episode and a reader page that streams pages as they complete.
- Planner calls Gemini when GEMINI_API_KEY is set (default model: gemini-2.5-flash); generation remains simulated; storage is in-memory.

Backend (NestJS) — Status
Implemented
- Endpoints
  - POST /planner — accepts seed (title, genre_tags, tone, setting, visual_vibe, cast), creates an episode, and now calls Gemini to return { episodeId, outline } with a real 10-page outline. Falls back to a stub if GEMINI_API_KEY is not set or parsing fails.
  - GET  /episodes/:id — returns episode metadata including pages and rendererModel.
  - POST /episodes/:id/generate10 — sequentially simulates generation of pages 1–10 and emits SSE events.
  - GET  /episodes/:id/stream — SSE endpoint streaming page_progress, page_done, and page_failed events.
  - GET  /pages/:id — returns page metadata from storage (in-memory or Prisma if enabled).
  - POST /pages/:id/read — placeholder returns 501 Not Implemented style payload.
- Planner integration
  - Uses @google/generative-ai and reads GEMINI_API_KEY from env; model configurable via PLANNER_MODEL (default gemini-2.5-flash).
  - Robust JSON extraction with strict shape validation (expects 10 pages).
- Persistence (Prisma)
  - Prisma schema for Episode/Page with PageStatus enum.
  - If DATABASE_URL is set, planner creation writes Episode + 10 Page rows; simulated generation updates Page rows.
  - If DATABASE_URL is not set, in-memory storage is used.
- Queueing (BullMQ)
  - QueueService scaffolding for generate_page (enabled when REDIS_URL is set).
  - Worker stub (npm run worker:generate) uses RENDERER_IMAGE_MODEL default and updates Page rows (if DB enabled).
- SSE/Event Bus
  - In-memory RxJS Subjects keyed by episodeId, emitting event payloads matching Appendix B shapes (page_progress, page_done, page_failed).
- Generation flow (simulated)
  - Sequential page generation with progress ticks and final page_done events.
  - Placeholder image URLs (https://placehold.co/1024x1536) are returned.

Partial
- Input validation: Only minimal checks; should add DTOs and class-validator.
- Error handling: Basic; needs standardized error responses.
- Edit flow: Not yet exposed; structure allows adding re-enqueue logic later.
- Continuity rules: Referenced but not enforced (no real image conditioning, only simulated flow).
- Configuration: CORS hard-coded for http://localhost:3000; should move to config/env.
- Persistence/Queueing: Prisma and BullMQ scaffolding are present; migration and GPU worker wiring pending.

Not Implemented (v0.2 targets that require infra)
- BullMQ (Redis) job queues and real worker processes.
- GPU worker integration (ComfyUI + Nano Banana + IP-Adapter, img2img, ControlNet Lineart).
- S3/R2 upload of generated page PNGs.
- Prisma + Postgres models and persistence of Episode/Page/Outline metadata.
- Vision/OCR and TTS (e.g., Gemini for text extraction, ElevenLabs for audio).
- Observability (Sentry + OTEL) and structured logging.

Frontend (Next.js) — Status
Implemented
- New Episode form (pages/index.tsx) to collect seed (title, genre tags, tone, setting, optional vibe, cast list) and call the backend.
- Reader page (pages/episodes/[id].tsx) that subscribes to SSE and reveals pages as page_done events arrive.

Partial
- Styling: Plain inline styles; no Tailwind yet.
- Reader: Renders full-page images; no panel layout (React-Konva) or editing capabilities yet.
- Read button (Vision→TTS): Not present; backend endpoint is stubbed only.

Not Implemented
- Editor UI to modify prompts and reflow downstream pages.
- Panel layout drawing/interaction (React-Konva).
- CBZ/EPUB3 export; audio streaming.

What I need from you
- Environment and runtime
  - Confirm backend port (4000) and frontend port (3000), or provide alternates.
- Data model (v0.1 reference)
  - If you have an existing v0.1 schema, please share it to align Prisma models.
- Credentials and integration details
  - Postgres DATABASE_URL
  - Redis URL for BullMQ
  - S3/R2 credentials (endpoint/region/bucket names)
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash API access details for Planner
  - ElevenLabs API key (or alternate TTS provider)
  - GPU worker endpoint(s) for Comfy/Nano Banana + any required auth
- Product choices
  - Use Tailwind + React-Konva on the frontend now, or defer until after backend integrations?
  - Any specific UI/UX mocks or brand styles to follow?

Recommended next steps (once you confirm)
1) Persistence (Prisma + Postgres)
   - Define Episode, Page, and Outline models; migrate; replace in-memory store.
2) Queueing (BullMQ + Redis)
   - Implement generate_page queue; separate worker process for page generation lifecycle (even if simulated initially).
3) Planner integration (Gemini)
   - Implement strict JSON response parsing into PlannerOutput; validate schema.
4) Renderer worker integration (Comfy/Nano Banana)
   - Wire Page 1 detailed prompt and Page 2–10 continuation templates with reference images; upload to S3/R2.
5) Reader enhancements
   - Tailwind styling; basic panel grid rendering; add a Read button invoking /pages/:id/read once TTS is integrated.
6) Observability and DX
   - Sentry + OTEL, structured logs, error handling middleware.

How to run locally (after dependencies are installed)
- Backend: PORT=4000 npm run dev (in backend folder)
- Frontend: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:4000 npm run dev (in web folder)
- Optional: Prisma client codegen: npm run prisma:generate (requires prisma CLI)
- Optional: Worker stub: REDIS_URL=redis://... npm run worker:generate

Notes
- All generation is currently simulated with placeholders to demonstrate the streaming and UI flow per Warp v0.2.
- The code is designed so that swapping in real Planner/Renderer/Queues/Storage later should require minimal changes to the API surface.
